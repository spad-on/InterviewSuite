/**
 * Exercise:
 *  Return the kth element in an array.
 *  The K-th element is the number that would be in the k-th position
 *  if the entire array was sorted.
 *  E.g.
 *     in: [1, 5, 4, 6, 3] k=3
 *    out: 4   since the third element in [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] is 4
 * Pre-Conditions: The 'array' is not sorted
 * Pre-Conditions: 1 <= k <= array.length
 *
 * Try to come up with an algorithm having time complexity O(n)
 *
 * Hint: the class name says a lot.
